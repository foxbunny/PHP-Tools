Collection of various useful (?) tools for PHP
==============================================

This is a repository of various bits of PHP that I'm writing for my own needs.
I'm sharing it here in hopes that they will come in handy for some of you.

If you find bugs or you think you can improve it, I ask you to please contact
me or file a bug report.

The code may be poorly documented and/or tested as I publish them as soon as I
write them, so feel free to contact me if something is not clear.
